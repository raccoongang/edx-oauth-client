# edx_oauth_client
SSO Generic Client for OAuth Identity Provider (ID).
### Instalation guide
 - Setup your ID site as OAuth2 server. Add client for OpenEdx
Redirect uri must be **http://<edx_url>/auth/complete/custom-oauth2/**

 - Install this client
   ```
   pip install git+https://github.com/raccoongang/edx-oauth-client.git#egg=edx_oauth_client
   ```

 - Enable THIRD_PARTY_AUTH in edX

    In the edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json file, edit the file so that it includes the following line in the features section.       And add  this backend.
    ```
    ...
    "FEATURES" : {
        ...
        "ENABLE_COMBINED_LOGIN_REGISTRATION": true,
        "ENABLE_THIRD_PARTY_AUTH": true,
        "ENABLE_CUSTOM_OAUTH_BACKEND": true,
        ...
    }
    ...
    "CUSTOM_OAUTH_PARAMS": {
        "PROVIDER_URL": "https://example.com",
        "AUTHORIZE_URL": "/oauth2/authorize",
        "GET_TOKEN_URL": "/oauth2/access_token",
        "PROVIDER_ID_KEY": "<unique identifier>",
        "USER_DATA_URL": "/api/v0/users/me"
    },
    ```

    `CUSTOM_OAUTH_PARAMS` should be added to the `lms/envs/common.py` if
    it is not supored by used OpenEdx.

    Custom backend is switched on by setting flag
    "ENABLE_CUSTOM_OAUTH_BACKEND" to true, if this functionality is not
    supported by used OpenEdx it could be added manually.
    ```
    "THIRD_PARTY_AUTH_BACKENDS":["edx_oauth_client.backends.generic_oauth_client.GenericOAuthBackend"],
    ```

 - Add in file **lms/envs/common.py**. It's preffered to place it
 somewhere at the top of the list
    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'edx_oauth_client',
        ...
    )
    ```

 - Add provider config in edX admin panel /admin/third_party_auth/oauth2providerconfig/
   - Enabled - **true**
   - backend-name - **custom-oauth2**
   - Skip registration form - **true**
   - Skip email verification - **true**
   - Client ID from Provider Admin OAuth Tab
   - Client Secret from Provider Admin OAuth Tab
   - Make it visible ? + link on Edx
   - name slug should be the same as provider name ? temp

 - If you're want seamless authorization add middleware classes for
 SeamlessAuthorization (crossdomain cookie support needed)
   ```
   MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += ("edx_oauth_client.middleware.SeamlessAuthorization",)
   ```

   This feature requers to update you SSO Provider site's behaviour:

   Create multi-domain cookies named “authenticated”=1 and
   “authenticated_user”=”<username>” if user is logged in. And delete
   these cookies on logout

   Also you should initiate user creation on edX after user creation on
   Provider. You need to send GET request to Edx API on url:
   ```
   https://<edx-url>/auth/complete/custom-oauth2/?state=<state>&code=<code>
   ```

   Where `state` is md5(time()) and `code` is code for authorization
   (create it if doesn't exist)

**Note.** If you work on local devstack. Inside your edx’s vagrant in
/etc/hosts add a row with your machine’s IP and provider’s vhost. For
example:
```192.168.0.197 sso.local```
